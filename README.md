# My-OpenGL-Engine
A simple 3D graphics engine written with OpenGL for me to play around with

<hr>
The reason behind starting this project was to learn following things:
  1. C++ Project structure conventions
  2. Makefiles
  3. OpenGL, GLFW, GLM and other libraries
  4. How bad a raytracer written by me would work (13 FPS on my laptop)

I don't intend to further improve this project for public use
